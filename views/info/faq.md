This FAQ is based off of a [public FAQ document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lA0GZiFDUfcaLKOJ7M4ob15_Utkrl8iWF_UXNzj5SzU/edit#)
released by Horrible People.

It has been reorganized to (hopefully) be easier to navigate in this web version. Every question has been tagged
so that questions about any specific card/concept can be found by shift-clicking the card in game or by
searching for that card in the [Card Reference](/info/cardlist) page. This page, with all the questions laid out
in a single document, is for legacy purposes.

Any ways tsssf.net deviates from this FAQ will be signified with <del>strike through text</del> and <ins>inserted text</ins>

	<ul class="c11 lst start"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Can two-pony cards count as the same pony twice, or just two one-pony cards in the same spot?<br></span><span class="c2">A: </span><span class="c4">Two-pony cards do not count as two of the same pony; they're a team of two different ponies!</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Can a changeling become a 2-Pony card, like Aloe &amp; Lotus?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A changeling can become only a single pony. So it can become Aloe, but not Lotus, or the other way around.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: When you ship a card to Flim/Flam or Aloe/Lotus, does that count as 2 ships?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes. Two ponies and two ships. As a side note, any card that changes one of the attributes of a Pony card (e.g. gender, race) will change that attribute for both Flim/Flam at the same time. So there's no way for a single card to have both a female Flim and a male Flam.<br></span></li>
		<li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: What if you ship Flim &amp; Flam with Aloe &amp; Lotus? How many ships is that?<br>A:</span><span class="c15">
				&nbsp;To keep things simple, it still only counts as 2 ships.</span>
		</li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: OK, I think the card text makes this perfectly clear. But does a Gender Change or Race Change affect both ponies on a two-pony card? <br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;They do!</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst start"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Can a changeling become a 2-Pony card, like Aloe &amp; Lotus?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A changeling can become only a single pony. So it can become Aloe, but not Lotus, or the other way around.</span></li></ul>


	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: The Wonderbolts card says "counts as a single pony", and the Changeling card says "becomes a copy of any single [pegasus symbol] of your choice". Does this mean the changeling card can be used as a copy of the Wonderbolts?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A changeling can become a member of the Wonderbolts, yep! </span></li></ul>


	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Do changelings only copy ponies on the board or ANY pony at all (player's choice)?<br>A: </span><span class="c4">The changelings can copy any pony in the game - but are restricted to their race. Chrysalis, for example, can only become alicorns!</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: A question on changelings! I know disguises only last for the player's turn, but what about if you ship something to a changeling on another turn and it doesn't have a disguise up? I'm assuming it still counts as its race, but what about gender? They're unique in having no gender. And if I Rule 63 such a changeling, does it stay at 'no gender' or does it go all the way to the other end of the spectrum and become both male and female?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It does not count as anything but a null card -- which is why their symbols are black! The only exception is that Chrysalis counts as a female. Introducing a Rule 63 card to a non-gendered changeling does not introduce a gender to them, alas!</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Can you ship the Wonderbolts (Who can become any sex) and a Pegasi Changeling (Who gain the Characteristics of the Wonderbolts) and count that towards the Goals Budding Curiosity or Charity Auction?.<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Interesting question! <del>I'd say probably yes.</del><ins>No, the both gender cards doesn't count for the goals which require changing the gender.</ins></span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Can you change a changeling's race?<br>A: </span><span class="c4">Race change cards do not affect what race a Changeling can become, but it can change the race of a Changeling after it's changed. For example, an Earth Pony Changeling can become an Alicorn Pinkie Pie.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: The rules say as an example that an earth Changeling can become an alicorn Pinkie Pie (in one move, by becoming an earth Pinkie then having her race changed). But if a Pinkie on the board becomes an alicorn for the turn, does that allow Chrysalis to become an alicorn Pinkie Pie?<br>A: </span><span class="c4">While this is technically allowed by the wording of the cards, I&rsquo;m not sure it goes with the spirit of the cards. However, I also don&rsquo;t see it being very abusive. Go with whatever your group decides!</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: My First Slash. Can it really be won if you use the unicorn changling to stand in for Shining Armor?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yes.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Changelings gain all of the symbols of the card they mimic. Does that mean that if Queen Chrysalis (who is already female) mimics Discord, she gains the male symbol and counts as both a male and a female simultaneously?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;<del>This was not our original intention, but I believe you're correct! By default, symbols and keywords are not replaced when others are gained, so Chrysalis would become a Discord who is both male and female at the same time.</del><ins>When a changeling gains a symbol, it replaces its previous symbol. When a changeling gains a name/keyword, it gains them in additional to its original name/keywords.</ins></span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Changelings don't gain powers, but what if one mimics the Wonderbolts? Does that combined male/female gender symbol imply that it can be either gender anyway?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A Changeling copying the Wonderbolts earns their symbol, so they have the same ability.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: Do Changelings' Powers only activate on the turn they are played, and when they are moved, or on every turn?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Changeling powers are activated only when they're played, when they're moved, when their power is activated by connecting them to an adjacent pony with a Ship card, or when a power might activate another pony's power. They don't activate every turn.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: I play a Changeling copying a pony on the grid, then use a Swap power to swap the 'ling with the original. Does this count as breaking up the ship?<br>A: </span><span class="c4">Yep! It's still a different Pony, even if it's the same &hellip; pony.<br></span></li>
		<li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2 c19">Q: What happens when I play a Gender Change ship on a multi-gendered card, like the Wonderbolts? What about on a non-gendered card, like a changeling?<br>A:</span><span class="c19 c15">&nbsp;A Gender Change ship has no effect on a multi-gendered Pony card, or on a Pony card with no gender.</span></li></ul>

	<ul class="c11 lst start"><li class="c12 bullet"><span class="c2 c19">Q: How does the Derpy Hooves card work?</span><span class="c19 c15"><br></span><span class="c2 c19">A: </span><span class="c19 c15">Derpy Hooves is played like any other Pony card. When she is attached to the grid via a ship card is when her power triggers, and you must swap Fan Fiction Author Twilight with any other Pony card. Derpy can be discarded, swapped, and pulled from the discard pile like any other Pony card, and her power can be activated after she's already on the grid like any other power.</span></li></ul>

Two ponies and two ships. As a side note, any card that changes one of the attributes of a Pony card (e.g. gender, race) will change that attribute for both Flim/Flam at the same time. So there's no way for a single card to have both a female Flim and a male Flam.</span></li></ul>

However, we've still been getting a number of complaints, especially about how easy it is to abuse pony powers.<br>If you don't like how a particular mechanic plays, we highly encourage houseruling it to what feels right.

Or if you got to move two different ponies with two other ponies on the board and that counted as swap two ponies.<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;By picking up two ponies and switching their places, you're swapping two ponies!</span></li></ul>

Until the end of your turn, that Pony card counts as two ponies." Well, can we choose Aloe &amp; Lotus and make that card four ponies?</span><span class="c2"><br>A:</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c24 c15">Any Pony CARD you choose will count as two Ponies. Since Aloe &amp; Lotus is a single Pony card, it will simply continue to be two Ponies.</span></li>
		<li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: </span><span class="c2">If you have a goal that is satisfied when two of the same ponies are shipped together, can you satisfy that goal by cloning the goal pony and shipping it to another unrelated pony? (Ex. Rodeo. (Two AJs Shipped Together) I have Sharpshooter Applejack and Major General Rainbow Dash on the board. Could I claim Rodeo if I used a Clone Ship between those two and used its power to clone AJ?)<br>A: </span><span class="c15">Nope! Those two cloned ponies are not shipped together; they are merely two ponies on the same card. To ship two ponies together they HAVE to be connected by a Ship card.</span></li></ul>

My friend and I agreed that that counted for the goal, but I'm a bit unconvinced in hindsight, what would you say?<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Good question! <del>I'd say, for sake of keeping things simple, that totally works. &ldquo;Lol, whoops, ACTUALLY I'M A DUDE&rdquo; is a totally valid play. But that is also a thing that I think can absolutely be answered group to group if that answer is unsatisfactory.

	<ul class="c11 lst"><li class="c5 bullet"><span class="c2">Q: OK, I think the card text makes this perfectly clear. But does a Gender Change or Race Change affect both ponies on a two-pony card? <br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;They do!</span></li></ul>

Sometimes people would like to cause something to get discarded in order to use a "play from discard" power and activate the other card's power.

I had a situation where I wanted to use a race-changing ship card and attach a new pony with a swap power, and the order of operations mattered.<br>A:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The order of operations is thus: you play the ship card, then the pony card to attach it to. Then the Ship's power is activated. Then the Pony's power is activated. Therefore, you would race-change one of the two cards in the original ship, and not the pony you swapped into the ship. <ins>This is not precisely true in the online version. When initially attached to the grid, changeling powers will activate prior to the ship, but otherwise this holds.</ins></span></li></ul>
